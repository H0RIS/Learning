/*
Write a program that prompts the user to enter some number of pennies (1-cent coins), nick
els (5-cent coins), dimes (10-cent coins), quarters (25-cent coins), half dollars (50-cent
 coins), and one-dollar coins (100-cent coins). Query the user separately for the number of
 each size coin, e.g., ‘‘How many pennies do you have?’’ Then your program should print out
 something like this:
 You have 23 pennies.
 You have 17 nickels.
 You have 14 dimes.
 You have 7 quar ters.
 You have 3 half dollars.
 The value of all of your coins is 573 cents.
 Make some improvements: if only one of a coin is reported, make the output grammatically
 correct, e.g., 14 dimes and 1 dime (not 1 dimes). Also, report the sum in dollars and cents,
 i.e., .73 instead of 573 cents.
