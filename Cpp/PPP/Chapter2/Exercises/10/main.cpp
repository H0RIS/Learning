/*
Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For
 example:
 + 100 3.14
 ∗ 4 5
 Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which
 operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables
 of type double. Implement this for operations called +, −, ∗, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with
 their obvious meanings.
